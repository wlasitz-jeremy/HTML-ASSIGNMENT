    <nav><p>The hobbies I am most passionate about would have to be <a href="https://www.calgaryclimbing.com/">rock climbing</a> and motorcycle riding. When I'm rock climbing I feel connected to nature and my stress levels fade away.There is a bond between you and the rock, an unforgivable bond that has zero margin for error at times. My personal projects involve becoming a better climber and being able to one day climb the 3000 ft granite rockface of El Capitain or the 2000ft granite rockface of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park in California.<br><br>I am a dedicated and adaptable professional seeking a full-time position. With a diverse background spanning military service, construction work, and customer service, I bring a strong work ethic, resilience, and teamwork skills to any role.</p></nav>
