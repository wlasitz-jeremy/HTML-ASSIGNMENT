<p>In my spare time i really enjoy <a href="https://www.calgaryclimbing.com/">rock climbing</a> and motorcycle riding. When im rock climbing I feel connected to nature and my stress levels fade away. I love rock climbing becuase its like you're trying to solve a puzzle, the puzzle of how do you get up the wall. There is a bond between you and the rock. An unforgivable bond that has zero margin for error at times.</p>
